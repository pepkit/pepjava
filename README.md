# pepjava

This is a java library to read and process [PEP](http://pep.databio.org/en/latest/specification/) specifications.

## How to use

Currently, the MainClass.java file shows how to instantiate the functionality. The key classes to use are:

``
YamlProject
SampleTable
``

Methods within SampleTable that start with _process_ (processImply, processDerive...) are of particular interest.

## Status

No unit tests yet. Not of any quality to advertise. Work in progress.
